# Alpha Blending

Alpha blending is the process of blending multiple colors together into one final color, based on certain factors.
Typically, only two colors called the _source color_ and _destination color_ participate in this process.

Imagine you have a window with a blue background color, and you now draw a red sprite into it.
In this case, the window's background color is the _destination_ color, while the sprite's color is the
_source_ color.

The blending process is performed for each pixel of the sprite.
