This is a port of the XNA Platformer Demo (https://github.com/SimonDarksideJ/XNAGameStudio/tree/archive/Samples/Platformer_4_0)
using cerlib. It showcases how cerlib is used to implement a typical, simple 2D platformer and represents a good overall test
for the framework's components (graphics, input, audio).

A live web demo is available at https://cerlib.org/demo.
